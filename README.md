## A multicollinearity diagnostics package

The mcperturb package identifies uses small perturbations of noise to identify multicollinearity amongst continuous regressors of a multiple linear regression model
Ideally it is run in a R environment system. This package includes the following documents and folders:

mcperturb.user.manual.pdf: A copy of the user manual
code: A folder containing all R source code files used for the mcperturb package.
